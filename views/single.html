          <h2> <b> What is a healthy lifestyle, exactly?</b></h2>
        </p>
        <p class="lead"> Here is how the healthy habits are defined and measured:<br>

          <br>1. <i><u> Healthy diet</u></i>, which is calculated and rated based on the reported intake of
          healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids, and
          unhealthy
          foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium.<br>

          <br>2.<i><u> Healthy physical activity level</u></i>, which is measured as at least 30 minutes per day
          of moderate to vigorous activity daily.<br>

          <br>3. <i><u> Healthy body weight</u></i>, defined as a normal body mass index (BMI), which is between
          18.5 and 24.9.<br>

          <br>4.<i><u> Smoking</u></i>, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. "Healthy" here meant never
          having
          smoked.<br>

          <br>5. <i><u>Moderate alcohol intake</u></i>, which is measured as between 5 and 15 grams per day for
          women,
          and 5 to 30
          grams per day for men. Generally, one drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol. That’s 12 ounces of
          regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.
        </p>
        <p><br><br>
          <h2> <b> Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference?</b></h2>
          <p class="lead"> As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. According to this analysis,
            people who met criteria for all five habits enjoyed significantly, impressively longer lives than those
            who had
            none: 14 years for women and 12 years for men (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none
            of
            these habits were far more likely to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">Study investigators also calculated life expectancy by how many of these five healthy habits
          people had. Just one healthy habit (and it didn’t matter which one) … just one… extended life expectancy
          by two years in men and women. Not surprisingly, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their
          lifespan. This is one of those situations where I wish I could reprint their graphs for you, because
          they’re so cool.
        </p>
        <p class="lead"> This is huge. And, it confirms prior similar research — a lot of prior similar research. A
          2017 study using data from the Health and Retirement Study found that people 50 and older who were normal
          weight, had never smoked, and drank alcohol in moderation lived on average seven years longer. A 2012
          mega-analysis of 15 international studies that included over 500,000 participants found that over half of
          premature deaths were due to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet, inactivity, obesity, excessive
          alcohol intake, and smoking. And the list of supporting research goes on.</p>
